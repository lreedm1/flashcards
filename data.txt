	Coherent Governance is a tool for increasing board effectiveness. It is based on Policy Governance, which is one of the  Governance Models
	Four main concepts:
		1. Results
		2. Operational Expectations (OE) - Policies to increase board effectiveness through delegation
		3. Board-CEO Relations - Clear & unambiguous delegation of power to the CEO
		4. Governance Culture - Intentional reformation of board culture (job description, daily behavior, accountability)
		5. The model should be followed when it increases board effectiveness, and ignored when it does not. 
	
**Prerequisites**
	Commit to:
		1. Effort & uncomfortability of implementing Coherent Governance
		2. Serving clients & owners better
		3. Delegating to the CEO & holding them accountable
		5. Establishing clear & reasonable expectations for CEO
	
**How to Implement Coherent Governance**
	1. Create a new set of policies that align with Coherent Governance. These will be called Organizational Policy
	2. Delegate all existing policies to the CEO. These will be called Governing Policy
	3. Design a model to inform staff of the changes caused by Coherent Governance with the CEO

**How to Monitor Board Culture & Board-CEO Relation Policy**
	1. Compare organizational policy with performance of board. There are three options:
		1. Self-monitor
		2. Organize an external monitoring committee
		3. Hire a monitoring consultant/company
	2. Create a mechanism to self-correct & self-improve
	3. Clarify Board & CEO roles when necessary
	4. Create a Board & CEO succession plan
	
**How to Monitor Operational Expectations (OE) Policies**
	During the creation of policy, inform the CEO that they:
		1. Will be treated in good faith during the process
		2. Are expected to reasonably interpret OE Policies in alignment with the Board's values
		3. Will be expected to produce Monitoring Reports at the end of each policy deadline. Monitoring reports are documents that explain three things:
				1. The CEO's interpretation of OE policies
				2. The CEO's self-assesment of OE performance
				3. Evidence to back up the CEO's self-assessment
	During the review of policy:
		1. Review the CEO's performance of OE policies using their Monitoring Report
		2. Approve/Deny the monitoring report depending on the CEO's evidence

How to evaluate the CEO through Coherent Governance
